Add read-only mode and tile control visibility

Introduce read-only mode to disable marker interactions and hide tile control when not needed. This enhances flexibility for users who require a non-interactive map view or want to simplify the UI by removing the tile selector. Also, improve error handling for location services by using Filament notifications instead of alerts.
